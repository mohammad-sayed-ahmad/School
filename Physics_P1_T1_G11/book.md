# Chapter 1: Temperature and Heat

## C 1.1 Sensation of hotness and temperature

### ACTIVITY 1
Place one hand in cold water and the other hand in hot water, for a couple of minutes.
Take your hands out and place them in warm water. What will each hand feel?

Such experiences lead us to the following generalization:

> **Heat sensation**
> "Our sense of heat tells us whether heat energy is leaving our skin, the case in which we feel the sensation of coldness, or whether heat energy is entering our body through our skin, the case in which we feel the sensation of hotness".

Can you recall other experiences that verify the above generalization?

Is there such a thing as absolute hotness? If yes, our sensation of hotness, being relative, cannot determine that. Hence, instruments other than our sense of hotness are required. Scientists believe that there is an absolute measure of hotness that we call temperature.

> **Temperature**
> Temperature may be defined as the degree of hotness of a body, a property which can change and be measured.

Scientists believe that physical changes always take place at the same temperature, anywhere in the universe, and at any time. For instance, under a pressure of 1 atm, water boils at 100°C on the surface of the Earth.

Under the same pressure, at what temperature will water boil on the moon?

Matter has properties that seem to change with hotness, like the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure, the length of a certain rod of steel, the length of a column of liquid inside a glass tube, etc.

Can you think of another property of matter that changes with hotness?

> **Thermometric properties**
> Thermometric properties are properties of objects that can be used to make thermometers, such as the change of volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure. They are called thermometric properties because they can be used to measure temperature.

Not any property that changes with temperature is a thermometric property. Thermometric properties have to be measurable, that is, they have to have different values at different temperatures, but the same value under the same conditions.

### ACTIVITY 2
Which of the following are thermometric properties? Give reasons.
(a) The hardness of egg white.
(b) The length of mercury in a mercury-in-glass thermometer.
(c) The mass of a fixed quantity of gas.

### Experiment
"Every time you place the same thermometer in melting ice, the liquid inside it will reach the same level".

Gather evidence to support this generalization by experiment and write up your results.
Give a full description of the equipment used, the procedures you followed, the precautions you took, the number of repetitions, etc.

> **Thermometers**
> Thermometers are instruments that utilize a particular thermometric property to measure temperature. The mercury-in-glass, alcohol-in-glass, thermocouple and bimetallic strip thermometers are examples you will encounter in this course.

### ACTIVITY 3
Name the thermometric property used in each of the above four thermometers.

## C 1.2 Temperature scale

To measure temperature, a temperature scale and a unit are needed. We will learn how to construct a Celsius scale of temperature. Specifically, we will use a mercury-in-glass thermometer to build our temperature scale.

> **Ice point**
> In these notes, we will use the term ice point to represent the point on the thermometer which corresponds to the tip of the mercury column when the thermometer is in thermal equilibrium with melting ice at a pressure of one atmosphere. On the Celsius scale, the temperature of the thermometer, when the mercury level is at this point, is defined to be 0°C.

> **Steam point**
> Similarly, the term steam point is used to represent the point on the thermometer which corresponds to the tip of the mercury column when the thermometer is in thermal equilibrium with the steam above boiling water at a pressure of one atmosphere (i.e. around 1.01 x 10⁵ Pa). On the Celsius scale, the temperature of the thermometer when the mercury level is at this point, is defined as 100°C.

### Experiment: Checking the calibration of a Celsius thermometer. This experiment is to be done in teams of two.

*[Diagram showing a thermometer in a funnel of melting crushed ice, marking the lower fixed point or ice point at 0°C. Another diagram shows a thermometer in a beaker of boiling water, with the bulb just above the water in the steam, marking the upper fixed point or steam point at 100°C.]*

1.  Using the procedure shown in the first diagram above, mark the ice point on the thermometer.
2.  Set up the apparatus shown in the second diagram above. Once the water starts to boil, heat very gently.
3.  Ensure that the thermometer bulb is just above the surface of the boiling pure water. (If the thermometer is submerged in the water it will read the temperature of the water, which may be superheated, but if it remains just above it, it will read the temperature of the steam in equilibrium with the water.)
4.  Wait until the reading of the thermometer is constant, then note the reading in your lab book.
5.  Take the reading of the barometric pressure in the room.
6.  Answer the following questions, and include the answers in the report you hand in to your teacher (after completing the next section).
    (a) Why should there be a second hole in the cork?
    (b) Supposing that the reading of the barometer was 760 mm Hg, and that your temperature reading was NOT 100°C. What do you conclude?
    (c) Supposing that the reading of the barometer was NOT 760 mm Hg, and that your temperature reading was 100°C. What do you conclude?

The above experiment is regarded as a tool to assess manipulative skills. It is an excellent example of the need for awareness of correct safety procedures when working in the laboratory. There are three principal hazards, of which you should be aware: (a) fragile glassware, (b) toxic mercury and (c) extreme heat.

> #### Hazards
> **(a) Fragile glassware:** The only way any glass can break during this experiment is if someone is careless. Always arrange your apparatus so that you know exactly where everything is. You can only mistakenly knock something over if you don't know where it (or what your colleagues) put it. Take personal mature responsibility for your own safety.
> A common blunder is to snap a thermometer while trying to insert it into a hole that is too small. Most thermometers have rubber grommets to prevent them slipping, so you can afford to use a large hole in the bung. The jagged end of a glass thermometer is a lethal weapon. If it is unavoidable to insert the thermometer into a tight bung, wrap the hand holding the bung in a towel, twist slowly while pushing, and apply no lateral forces. "Bravery" in the face of this hazard can result in severe injuries and should be avoided. It is common sense, not cowardice, to inform yourself about all the dangers and to take steps to avoid them.
>
> **(b) Mercury:** If you do break a thermometer, mercury will leak out. Report the spillage immediately to the laboratory supervisor (usually the teacher). The spilt mercury is mopped up by "flowers of sulphur" (ordinary sulphur powder), and the resulting sludge can be scraped up like any other spillage. Do not chase little droplets of mercury around the lab. Apart from this being undignified, ingested mercury (even in vapor form) is a cumulative poison which causes brain damage.
>
> **(c) Heat hazard:** The butane burner can cause serious burns, so you should (i) know where it is and (ii) turn it off and put it out of harm's way when not in use. Any suspected leak of gas should be reported to the laboratory supervisor. Steam can also give painful burns that can take a long time to heal. In this experiment, you should know that the flask itself is too hot to touch and the steam comes out of the right-angled glass tube at the top. So, don't touch them. Most serious burns are caused by involuntary muscle movements caused by minor burns (knocking over something very hot as a result of pulling a finger away from touching it accidentally). You can only accidentally touch something hot if either (i) you don't know it is hot, or (ii) you don't know where it is; both completely avoidable circumstances.

### The Celsius scale of Temperature

To calibrate the thermometer using the Celsius scale, proceed as follows:
1.  Measure the distance between the bottom end of the thermometer and the ice point. Call this length *l*₀.
2.  Measure the distance between the bottom end of the thermometer and the steam point. Call this length *l*₁₀₀.
3.  On graph paper, plot temperature in °C on the vertical axis, and length on the horizontal axis.
4.  Plot the two points (*l*₀, 0) and (*l*₁₀₀, 100) on the graph.
5.  Draw a straight line joining the two points above. By definition, the Celsius temperature scale is chosen to vary linearly with the thermometric property *l*.
6.  To determine the temperature of any object, insert the thermometer into the object and mark the position of the mercury. Measure the corresponding length *l*, and find the temperature from the graph.
7.  The "size" of a degree Celsius is 1/100 of the temperature difference between the temperature of the ice point (0°C) and that of the steam point (100°C). The corresponding difference for the thermometric property is 1/100 the distance between the ice-point and the steam-point. Show this on the graph, and hand in the lab report for checking.

#### EXERCISE 1.1
Describe an experiment used to check the calibration of a Celsius thermometer. What are the correct safety procedures that you need to be aware of? Explain.

Although the definition of the Celsius scale provides an objective and practical way of measuring the "hotness" of a body, it still suffers from its dependence on the thermometric agent used (mercury, alcohol, etc.). This is because different liquids (and solids) behave quite differently at different temperatures. Thus, if the readings of two liquid-in-glass thermometers (e.g. mercury and alcohol) are made to coincide at the ice and steam points, there is no guarantee they'll do so at any other temperature.

In contrast, all ideal gases behave in the same manner, and this makes them perfect candidates as thermometric agents for the definition of a physically meaningful temperature scale. But how do ideal gases respond to temperature changes?

Experiments with rarefied (low density) gases, whose behavior models that of ideal ones, show that *"for equal amounts of gas, the product of the pressure p the gas exerts on the walls of the container by the volume V of the latter is the same for all ideal gases at equal temperature t"* (i.e. at thermal equilibrium). This universal behavior of ideal gases is known as **Boyle's Law**.

## C 1.3 Gas Laws

### 1.3.1 Boyle's Law: Compressing a gas at constant temperature

#### Experiment
The diagram below shows a device which gives a reading of both volume and pressure of a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature.

*[Image of Boyle's Law apparatus showing a strong glass tube with trapped air, connected to a Bourdon gauge and an air foot pump via a reservoir of oil.]*

An amount of air is trapped in a strong glass tube by a column of oil. The oil is originally placed inside a reservoir. The pressure can be altered by pumping air from a foot pump into the space above the oil reservoir. The pressure can be read directly by the Bourdon pressure gauge. The pressure read is the sum of the actual pressure of the air and the atmospheric pressure. When no air has been pumped, the gauge reads the atmospheric pressure, p = 1.0 x 10⁵ Pa.

**How to perform the experiment?**
*   Slowly increase the pressure of the air using the foot pump.
*   Read the pressure on the Bourdon gauge and the corresponding volume from the vertical volume scale.
*   Repeat the experiment for several values of p and V.
*   Tabulate your results as shown below.

| p (kPa) | V (cm³) | p x V (MPa.cm³) | 1/p (1/MPa) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

*   Notice that as the pressure increases the volume decreases.
*   Moreover the product p x V is almost a constant.
*   Draw a graph of V/cm³ vs 1/p /MPa⁻¹

#### Outcome of the experiment
*   The graph should be a straight line passing through the origin.

*[Graph of Volume (cm³) vs 1/p (1/MPa) showing a straight line passing through the origin]*

*   We can say that V and 1/p are directly proportional or that V and p are inversely proportional.
*   The mathematical representation of Boyle's law is:
    V∝ 1/p or V = constant/p or pV = constant
*   Boyle's Law is stated as follows
    **"For a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure".**
*   Note: If V vs p is plotted, a curve like the one shown below is obtained.

*[Graph of Volume (cm³) vs p (MPa) showing a curve that decreases as p increases]*

### The Kelvin Scale
Boyle's law can be used to define the absolute temperature (or Kelvin) scale as follows
pV = cT
where C is a constant that depends on the amount of matter, i.e. the number of moles of the ideal gas) and T is the absolute temperature measured in kelvin (K). The kelvin is defined in such a way as to make the absolute temperature difference between the steam and ice points agree with the corresponding Celsius difference, i.e. T₁₀₀ - T₀ = 100 K. In other words the absolute temperature scale contains 100 kelvin between the ice and steam points, and a change in temperature of 1 K is identical to a 1°C change. On the other hand it is experimentally established that for a fixed amount of ideal gas the product pV at steam point is 1.3661 times its value at ice point, (i.e. T₁₀₀ = 1.3661T₀). Solving the last two equations for T₀ we get T₀ = 273.15 K from which we readily deduce T₁₀₀ = 373.15 K. The relation between the absolute and the Celsius scales that satisfies the above two requirements is of the form
T = θ + 273.15,
where θ is the temperature in degrees Celsius. We note that it is correct to write "degrees Celsius" and "kelvin" (with a small "k" for the word written out or a capital for the abbreviation: K); but it is incorrect to refer to "celsiuses" or "degrees Kelvin".

#### EXERCISES
**1.2** The temperature of a gas is raised from 10°C to 320.15 K. Calculate the change in the temperature of the gas and determine its final temperature in degrees Celsius.
**1.3** The absolute zero (T = 0) is the absolute temperature of an ideal gas at which all thermal movements of the gas molecules cease and the pressure drops to zero. Determine the corresponding temperature on the Celsius scale.
**1.4** Lord Kelvin (in honor of whom the absolute temperature scale is named) suggested the following procedure to define a temperature scale that makes use of our sense of hotness and two "virtually infinite" reservoirs of water at the fixed temperatures of melting ice and steam; mix hot water and ice water in measurable amounts in a beaker until the temperature of water feels the same as that of the desired body (e.g. sea water, oil, etc.). The temperature of the desired body is then defined as the ratio of the mass of hot water to the total mass of water in the beaker. Lord Kelvin believed that by means of the above described hands-on-water thermometer moderate temperatures can be measured with an accuracy of 0.25 K! Establish a relation between this temperature scale and the Celsius scale.

### ACTIVITY
An aerosol spray can contains liquid and compressed nitrogen. When the top is depressed, nitrogen forces the liquid out through the nozzle. The total volume of the container is 100 cm³.

(a) When the container is just empty of liquid, the pressure of the nitrogen is 6.0 x 10⁵ Pa at a temperature of 22°C.
    (i) What is the pressure of the nitrogen when the container is one quarter full of liquid at 22°C?
    (ii) When the container is one quarter full, the temperature increases to 50°C, what is the new pressure of the nitrogen?
    (iii) Why does the manufacturer instruct that the can must not be "exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures above 50°C"? What could be the result if this happened?
(b) During a 5 s burst, 7.5 g of liquid are sprayed out with an average speed of 2.5 m/s.
    (i) Find the gain in kinetic energy of the sprayed liquid and the average power of the spray.
    (ii) Do you think that this gain in kinetic energy of the sprayed liquid will result in a noticeable cooling of the contents of the can? Give a reason for your answer.

### Thermocouple
A thermocouple is a simple temperature sensor that consists of two dissimilar metallic wires, such as iron-constantan and copper-constantan. The wires are joined at two junctions so as to make a closed circuit. One junction, called the reference thermo-junction, is maintained at a fixed temperature and the other junction is used as a probe to measure the temperature of the desired body. When junctions have different temperatures, a weak thermoelectric current will flow in the circuit. This current can be detected by a galvanometer (G) (sensitive meter) whose reading is used to deduce the relative temperature of the probe junction.

*[Diagram of a thermocouple circuit with a hot junction, a cold junction, and a galvanometer.]*

*[Image showing a thermocouple measuring the temperature of a flame (850°C) and another measuring a beaker of water (37.2°C).]*

Thermocouples have low heat capacity which makes them respond quickly to changes in temperature and quickly reach thermal equilibrium with the body. Moreover thermocouples are very sensitive over a wide range of temperatures (4 K to 2700 K) with a relatively high precision (about 0.01 K).

### 1.3.2 Charles' Law: The Expansion Law for constant Pressure

*[Graphical representation of Charles' Law: a graph of V vs T showing a straight line through the origin.]*

If the pressure of a fixed amount of ideal gas is maintained constant, then the relation between the three macroscopic parameters p, V, and T, becomes V = kT.
This can be stated as *"at constant pressure the volume of a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature"*.

This statement is known as **Charles' law**. It would be noted that the volume in this case becomes a thermometric quantity whose value can be used to judge the temperature of gas and any other body in thermal equilibrium with it.

#### EXERCISES
**1.5** A fixed amount of gas occupies a volume of 27 liters at a temperature of 300 K. What volume will the gas occupy if its temperature is raised to 400 K? Assume the pressure doesn't change.
**1.6** The two compartments of a cylindrical tank, fitted with a thermo-insulating moveable piston, are filled with the same amount of gas.
a) Explain why at thermal equilibrium (equal temperatures) the piston settles into equilibrium half way between the bases of the cylinder.
b) The gas in the compartments is heated and the temperature of the right compartment is measured to be four times as high as that of the left one. Find the new position at which the piston will be at equilibrium.
c) Explain how slower molecules hitting the piston from the left balance the faster ones hitting it from the right.

### 1.3.3 The pressure Law: Heating a gas at constant Volume
"For a fixed amount of gas occupying a constant volume, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature" is the statement of the third gas law, known as the **Pressure Law**. The figure shows the graphical variation of pressure with temperature for a fixed amount of ideal gas of constant volume. In symbols, p ∝ kT.

*[p-T graph for a fixed volume of gas: a graph of p vs T showing a straight line through the origin.]*

#### EXERCISE 1.7
The temperature of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume is cooled from 91°C to -91°C. What happens to the pressure?

### 1.3.4 The gas equation
For ideal gases, the three equations between p, V, and T can be combined together to give the gas equation
**pV/T = constant (T in K).**
When p, V, and T all change from p₁, V₁, and T₁ to p₂, V₂, and T₂, then **p₁V₁/T₁ = p₂V₂/T₂**.
When T is constant the equation reduces to pV = constant (Boyle's Law), or p₁V₁ = p₂V₂.
When p is constant the equation reduces to **V/T = constant (Charles's Law), or V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂**.
When V is constant the equation reduces to **p/T = constant (Pressure Law), or p₁/T₁ = p₂/T₂**.

#### EXAMPLE 1.1
A foot air pump contains 100 cm³ of air at 17°C and at 1.0 atmosphere pressure. When air is compressed to 20 cm³, its temperature rises to 27°C. Determine its pressure then.

**SOLUTION**
Initial state: p₁ = 1.0 atm, V₁ = 100 cm³ and T₁ = 17°C = (17 + 273) K = 290 K.
Final state: p₂ = ?, V₂ = 20 cm³ and T₂ = 27°C = (27 + 273) K = 300 K.
Using **p₁V₁/T₁ = p₂V₂/T₂**, we get p₂ = p₁ x (V₁/V₂) x (T₂/T₁) = 1.0 x (100/20) x (300/290) ≈ 5.2 atm

#### EXERCISES
**1.8** A cylinder containing 0.04 m³ of helium at a pressure of 15 MPa is taken from town H to town C. The temperature of helium is found to be 27°C and 7.0°C in town H and C respectively.

b) The helium is then used to inflate identical balloons each to 0.010 m³ at a pressure of 100 kPa. Assuming the temperature of helium remains the same, determine the number of balloons that can be fully inflated using the gas available.
c) Practically the number of balloons is slightly less than what it was expected. Try to figure out the reason.
**1.9** a) State Boyle's law. b) Describe an experiment supporting Boyle's law.
**1.10** A car tire was tested before being driven on a motorway. The reading on the tire-pressure gauge, which reads the pressure above atmospheric pressure, was 120000 N/m² and the temperature was 7°C. At the end of the journey the temperature of the tire was found to be 35°C. What reading would you expect on the same tire pressure gauge if the volume of air in the tire remained constant and atmospheric pressure throughout the journey was also constant?
**1.11** An empty bottle is corked when the air inside is at 10°C and the barometer reads 75 cm of mercury. If the cork blows out when the pressure inside the bottle exceeds the atmosphere's pressure by 100 cm of mercury, calculate the temperature to which the bottle must be heated to cause the cork to be expelled. Assume that the volume of the bottle remains constant when heated.

## C 1.4 Change in temperature using Kinetic Theory

When you studied the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter, you learned that the molecules of any object undergo random motion, such that each particle possesses some kinetic energy, even at very low temperatures. The average kinetic energy E of the molecules of an object is directly proportional to the absolute temperature T of the object, that is **E = kT**.

This is the fundamental relation we sought between the temperature as a macroscopic quantity and the microscopic properties of matter. Thus, normally, if energy is added to an object such that the average kinetic energy of its molecules increases, its temperature increases.

---

### ACTIVITY
Answer by True or False.
1. The temperature of an object is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its molecules.
2. Moving a body increases its kinetic energy, thus, making it hotter.
3. The molecules of a hotter object have a higher concentration of heat energy than those of a colder object.
4. Fast moving molecules have a higher temperature than identical but slow moving ones.
5. Bodies can become hotter by converting their mechanical energy of macroscopic motion into the kinetic energy of their molecules' random motion. (Is the converse true?).
6. In air, oxygen molecules O₂ (molar mass 32 g) move faster than nitrogen molecules N₂ (molar mass 28 g).
7. If the average speed of a hydrogen molecule in air at room temperature is about 2 km/s, then the average speed of an oxygen molecule is about 0.5 km/s.

---

## C 1.5 Thermal properties of matter
Heat is internal energy, but temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy due to the random motion of the molecules of an object.
Heat energy is the kind of energy, which when added to an object, normally results in an increase in the kinetic energy of the molecules (the concentration of energy in the object increases). The total energy added to the body is measured in joules. This causes an increase in the average kinetic energy per molecule, which on the macroscopic scale manifests itself as an increase in temperature, measured in kelvins or degrees Celsius. The higher the temperature of an object, the more the random thermal energy of its particles (on average).

**Heat energy is needed to raise the temperature of a body.**

> The relationship of "heat energy" to "temperature" is the same as the relationship of "money" to "wealth". If you give some money to a group of persons their wealth increases. Similarly, if you give heat to matter, its temperature will increase.

### 1.5.1 Specific heat
The energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius is called the specific heat capacity denoted by c. Its unit is J kg⁻¹ °C⁻¹ or J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹. It follows that the quantity Q of energy required to raise the temperature of m kg of a substance by ∆T kelvin (or °C) is
**Q = mc∆T**

The following table lists the specific heat capacities of some substances:

| Substance | c (kJ kg⁻¹ K⁻¹) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Water | 4.2 |
| Ice | 2.1 |
| Iron | 0.48 |
| Copper | 0.39 |
| Aluminum | 0.90 |
| Silver | 0.25 |
*Approximate specific heat capacity*

#### EXAMPLE 1.2
If the specific heat capacity of water is 4.2 x 10³ J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹, calculate the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 10.00 kg of water from 312 K to 322 K.

**SOLUTION**
The change in temperature is ∆T = 10 K and the amount of heat required is
Q = 10.00 x 4.2 x 10³ x 10 = 4.2 x 10⁵ J.

#### EXAMPLE 1.3
Calculate the change in temperature of a 50 g silver spoon that loses 500 J of thermal energy to the surroundings.

**SOLUTION**
∆T = Q / mc = -500 / (0.05 x 0.25 x 10³) = -40 K

#### EXAMPLE 1.4
The heat capacity C of an object (or system of objects) is the energy needed to raise its temperature by 1 K. Calculate the heat capacity of 3 kg of water.

**SOLUTION**
To raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 K we need c joules, for 3.0 kg we shall need
C = (3.0 kg) c = 3.0 x 4.2 x 10³ J K⁻¹. Generally, the relation between c and C is C = mc, where m is the mass of the object.

---

#### EXAMPLE 1.5
5 kg of hot water at θ₁ = 75°C are mixed with 15 kg of cold water at θ₂ = 10°C. Determine the temperature θ of water at thermal equilibrium. Neglect energy losses to the container and surroundings.

**SOLUTION**
Let's denote by Q₁ and Q₂ the quantities of heat lost by the hot water and gained by the cold water, respectively (recall that spontaneous heat transfer occurs from hot to cold bodies).
We have Q₁ = m₁c(75 - θ) and Q₂ = m₂c(θ - 10) where m₁ = 5 kg and m₂ = 15 are the masses of hot and cold water, respectively. On the other hand, the law of conservation of energy requires the equality Q₁ = Q₂, which after substitution from above yields m₁c(75 - θ) = m₂c(θ - 10) or equivalently 5(75 - θ) = 15(θ - 10).
Solving for θ, we get θ = 26.25°C.

#### EXERCISES
**1.18** If the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 x 10³ J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹, calculate the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of:
a) 1.00 kg of water from 12°C to 13°C.
b) 10.00 kg of water from 312 K to 322 K.
**1.19** Two liters of water (of density 1000 kg/m³) are poured in an aluminum kettle of mass 0.4 kg. Calculate the heat capacity of the system water-kettle and determine the energy required to raise its temperature by 40 K.

**1.21** A 2.2 kg piece of lead is placed in an aluminum beaker, of mass 500 g, containing 10 liters of water. An electric heater, of power 2000 W, is used to heat the system from 20°C to 80°C in 2 min 22 sec. Determine the specific heat capacity of lead. Give one factor that affects your result and state how it does and how you can reduce its effect.
**1.22** A hammer of mass 3.00 kg is released from a height of 3.00 m above the ground. The hammer is stopped by a collision with a lump of lead of mass 200 g at rest on the ground. Only 40% of the energy of the hammer is used to heat up the lump of lead (specific heat capacity of lead is 130 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹, and g = 9.80 m/s²).
a) Calculate the increase in temperature of lead.
b) What happened to the 60% energy of the hammer?

### Experiment
#### Procedure

* The copper and aluminum blocks should have two holes drilled in them, so that the immersion heater and the thermometer can be placed inside each hole.
* Place the immersion heater in the central hole and the thermometer in the other hole.

*[Diagram of the experimental setup showing beakers with 1kg of copper, 1kg of aluminum, and 1kg of water, each with a thermometer and an electric heater.]*

* Add a few drops of lubricating oil to improve the heat transfer from the heater to the block.
* Add a few drops of oil in the thermometer hole in order to insure a good thermal contact.
* Read the initial temperature of the copper block and record it.
* Connect a 12 V, 50 W immersion heater to a low voltage power pack set at 12 V.
* Switch on the power pack and measure the time taken for a temperature rise of 10 K or 10°C.
* Repeat the experiment for the 1 kg aluminum block.
* Repeat also the experiment for the beaker containing 1 kg of water.

#### Outcome of Experiment
* Different materials need different times to warm up by 10 K.
* Different materials have different heat capacities.
* The heat capacity of a substance depends on what it is made of.
* Approximate times needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of each sample by 10°C: 1.5 minutes for copper, 3 minutes for aluminum and 15 minutes for water.
* Hence, the order of heat capacities from lowest to highest: copper, aluminum and water.

**The heat capacity of an object depends on its material.**
